## HOW TO USE ##################################################################
* You need the following:
- A command line interface.
- Python 3.
- The ".net" file corresponding to your petri file (see associated section).
- A translation table (see associated section), if there are any aliases in your
  Petri net.

Having transitions with labels such as:
ACTION_EN_COURS=0/initNave,ETALON_CAPT_LUMIERE,raiseArm
in your Petri net is authorised. Notice that "ACTION_EN_COURS=0" is LeJos
syntax, and "initNave" is an alias. To enter LeJos actions with a parameter
directly in your Petri net, you must use the syntax
"LEJOS_ACTION_NAME:PARAM_VALUE".

Calling the program:
python3 tina_converter.py [-t TRANSLATION_TABLE] NET_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Examples:
python3 tina_converter.py -t translation_table.txt question1.net out.rdp
python3 tina_converter.py question5.net out.rdp

## HOW TO GET THE .NET FILE ####################################################
Having modeled your Petri net under Tina (http://projects.laas.fr/tina/), you
can go in the "edit" menu and select "textify". You should be presented with
a textual representation of your Petri net. You should then be able to create
the ".net" file using the "File" menu, by selecting "save as".

## HOW TO BUILD YOUR TRANSLATION TABLE #########################################
The translation table is a text file in which each line represents an entry.

#### REPRESENTING A CONDITION
The syntax is as follows:
whatever_you_put_in_your_petri_net::THE_ACTUAL_VARIABLE::THE_OPERATOR::THE_VALUE
THE_OPERATOR should be included in {=,<,>,>=,<=}, or that field left empty
(which is apparently valid syntax, but I know nothing of the semantics).
THE_VALUE must be a positive integer (i.e. THE_VALUE >= 0). For 'boolean'
variables, you must use 1 for 'true' and 0 for 'false'.
Example:
noAction::ACTION_EN_COURS::=::0

#### REPRESENTING AN ACTION WITH NO PARAMETER
The syntax is as follows:
whatever_you_put_in_your_petri_net::THE_ACTUAL_NAME

#### REPRESENTING AN ACTION WITH PARAMETERS
The syntax is as follows:
whatever_you_put_in_your_petri_net::THE_ACTUAL_NAME::THE_VALUE
